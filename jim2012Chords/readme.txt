Guitar Only
===========

Database containing 2000 recordings of 10 guitar chords. This database is
well suited for the learning phase of a machine learning algorithm.

For each chord, there are 200 wav files sampled at 44.100 Hz and quantized at
16 bits.

100 first chords are recorded in an anechoic chamber and the 100 last are
recorded in a noisy room. 
Four guitar were used : 

WAV files:

[1-25]   : Guitar 1         
[26-50]  : Guitar 2
[51-75]  : Guitar 3
[76-100] : Guitar 4 

Other Instruments
=================

Database containing chords recording with four instruments: Guitar, Piano, 
Violin and Accordion.

For each instruments, there are 100 recordings, distributed in 10 chords 
(10 recordings per chord). All chords were recorded in a noisy room and with a 
single instrument.

This database is well suited as a test set for a machine learning algorithm
(it was designed for that).
